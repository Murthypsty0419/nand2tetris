I used the four classes to structure the program as specified in the book:
Main, Parser, SymbolTable & Code.

I tested my program files on the Assembler using them as a comparison to the corresponding .asm file (e.g.
running Max.asm and comparing with my hack code.) It worked for all of them (Max, MaxL, Add, AddL, Rect, RectL, Fill, and Mult)
